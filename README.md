# Weather-Detector
In this project, I created a Weather App using the Open Weather Map API. Python was used for coding and tkinter, requests and time libraries were used.
Using this app, one could easily get details like temperature(max/min), pressure, humidity, windspeed etc of any city in the entire world.
